Libero Publisher vanilla Helm chart
===================================

Scope
-----

This repository contains a functional Helm chart for the deployment of Libero Publisher.

The product is set up with a vanilla configuration:

- a single `article-store`
- an Hypermedia console

The chart is intended for installation on environments supporting the development of Libero products. Direct reuse of this chart from other organizations is not supported.

The chart can be forked and adapted liberally to create a new deployment solution, as it reflects a production-ready architecture.
